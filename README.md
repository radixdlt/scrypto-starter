This is a template for Scrypto development in a container based on the [VS Code Dev Containers Containers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers) extension.

## Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Visual Studio Code Dev Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)

## Usage

1. Clone this repository
2. Open the repository in Visual Studio Code
3. VS Code might suggest you to open the repository in a dev container, because of the existing `.devcontainer` config.
   - If it does, click "Reopen in container".
   - Otherwise, open the command palette and type "Reopen in container".
4. Wait for the VS Code to reopen. Docker might pull the image if it's not yet present before it start the container.
